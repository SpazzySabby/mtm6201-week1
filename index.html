                <p>My name is Sabrina Oursin, I am 39 years old, born and raised in Canada. I have lived an eventful life, one where I was sure I knew all the answers, I still think that from time to time even though I know I don't, the ego is such an asinine thing! I did not know how much I love education and learning, even though at the same time I don't, a complex creature I am. By this I mean, after a decade of having all the answers, now I don't and it's scary, a fear that I am encountering and overcoming daily. I am learning so much in this program, not just about my desired field, but about me! I was not taught how to communicate effectively, and while I am growing in this area, this program surrounds me with the experiences to learn this and opportunities for me to work on my emotional regulation, something else I neglected over the years. I am so excited that I finally got to go to college and do not plan on wasting it.</p>
                <p>While I unsure of what the future holds, I am sure that I will be successful if I keep my head in the game and continue to be excited by all the new cool things I am learning. I plan on being an entrepreneur, the whole reason I took this program is because you can do it while working anywhere in the world. My plan/dream is to work for myself, I want to create a name for myself by being hardworking, fair, and really good at my job! I already have the people skills, after being in customer service for 21 years I could sell ice to an eskimo if I beleive in the product enough, I've proven that by winning multiple sales competition throughout the years, and let's be honest, if I'm selling me, I've got this in the bag! I am a chamelion, always have been, so while I may come across as brash and outspoken, I can be anything I want to, I can charm the pants off of anyone, just show me the money! </p>
